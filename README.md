<h2>Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona</h2>

This repository contains the source code for multi-pitch extration, based on DeepSalience[1] and for source separation for the case of SATB choirs.

<h3>Installation</h3>
To install, clone the repository and use <pre><code>pip install requirements.txt </code></pre> to install the packages required.

 The main code is in the *main.py* file.  
 

<h3>Training and inference</h3>


Once setup, you can run the command <pre><code>python main.py -t</code></pre> to train.
Use <pre><code>python main.py -e <i>filename</i></code></pre> to calculate metrics for a file.
Use <pre><code>python main.py -v </code></pre> to calculate metrics for the entire validation set.

<h3>Evaluation</h3> 


 
We are currently working on future applications for the methodology and the rest of the files in the repository are for this purpose, please ignore. We will further update the repository in the coming months.
